required libraries:
    anaconda python has everything except 2 modules
    tensorflow 2.0, GPU preferred
    setproctitle; not necessary, can comment out those lines of code.
        sets the name of the process so its easily identified with ps
        or nvidia-smi

png2npy :
    convert raw images to numpy arrays for quicker file IO in cnvlstm
    
cl_input_1.py :
    input case file to feed into cnvlstm

cltrain :
    executable to train a 2D convolutional lstm
    saves model to a new directory with the same name as the input case name

clinfer : 
    executable to evaluate a trained 2D convolutional lstm
    makes series of images
    saves images to a new directory with the same name as the input case name

convlstm :
    class for loading data, building a model and training/inference

imageData.py :
    module to handle data IO

mkmovie : 
    convert images from cnvlstminfer to movie
